# ARGUMENTS LIST:
# name = sample_t_peakcalled
# format = BAM
# ChIP-seq file = ['sample_t.bam']
# control file = ['sample_c.bam']
# effective genome size = 1.87e+09
# band width = 300
# model fold = [5, 50]
# qvalue cutoff for narrow/strong regions = 5.00e-02
# qvalue cutoff for broad/weak regions = 1.00e-01
# The maximum gap between significant sites is assigned as the read length/tag size.
# The minimum length of peaks is assigned as the predicted fragment length "d".
# Larger dataset will be scaled towards smaller dataset.
# Range for calculating regional lambda is: 1000 bps and 10000 bps
# Broad region calling is on
# Paired-End mode is off

# tag size is determined as 36 bps
# total tags in treatment: 26644742
# tags after filtering in treatment: 15109694
# maximum duplicate tags at the same position in treatment = 1
# Redundant rate in treatment: 0.43
# total tags in control: 28072133
# tags after filtering in control: 20324741
# maximum duplicate tags at the same position in control = 1
# Redundant rate in control: 0.28
# d = 75
# alternative fragment length(s) may be 39,75 bps
